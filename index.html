        <h1>Hi, my name is Alikhan.</h1>

        <p>
          I am an engineer. I research and identify problems, break them down,
          and engineer resilient systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          My primary interests are in large-scale AI systems, full stack
          software engineering, distributed systems, and agentic AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in Central Asia and started programming in high school,
          where I first learned to code in the

          language, taught in a Soviet-style curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently study Computer Science at the

        <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p>As a 21-year-old Computer Science student, I combine ambition and curiosity with creativity. I love learning quickly and tackling challenges, whether it’s programming a project, playing guitar and piano, singing, or staying consistent in the gym. When it comes to Computer Science, my journey is personal and exciting—and in <a href="post.html">my post</a>, I share why I chose this field and what it means to me.</p>
        <p>I love playing guitar and combining it with singing. Blending the two skills can be challenging, especially keeping the rhythm, but I enjoy the challenge and the creativity it brings.</p>
        <p>I am always excited to learn something new that will give me fresh perspectives, improve my abilities, and bring me closer to achieving my goals.</p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <p>MAT 1400 - Analytic Geometry and Pre-Calculus Mathematics</p>
          </ul>
          <p>In this pre-calculus course we learn real numbers, open sentences, functions and relations, and serves as an introduction to analytic geometry and to probability.</p>

          <ul>
            <p>CS 1200 - Introduction to Computing</p>
          </ul>
          <p>In this course we study algorithms, programs, data representation, debugging and verification of programs. Numeric and non-numeric programming applications include searching and sorting algorithms, function and procedures, and number theory problems.</p>

          <ul>
            <p>CIS 100 - Digital Society</p>
          </ul>
          <p>This course is a consideration of how digital technologies impact individuals daily lives, social movements & civic activities. How the design and use of algorithms can be influenced by the culture and biases of those designing & using the technologies.</p>
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p class="bottom">My goal is to become a successful software engineer with strong technical expertise in computer science and artificial intelligence. I am highly ambitious, eager to learn, and adaptable to new challenges. With proven teamwork experience, leadership potential, and a passion for continuous improvement, I aim to contribute to innovative AI-driven solutions and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.</p>
