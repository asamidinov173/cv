      <h1>My Health Care</h1>

      <h2>"Sports are a key part of my life, helping me stay strong, disciplined, and balanced. Here is how I organize my week with swimming and gym sessions."</h2>

      <h2>Weekly Routine</h2>

        <ul>
          Swimming: 1x per week → focus on endurance, focus, overall fitness.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Gym: 5x per week → structured by muscle group. 
        </ul>
        <ul>Day 1: Chest & Triceps</ul>
        <ul>Day 3: Back & Shoulders</ul>
        <ul>Day 5: Legs & Arms</ul>
        <ul>Days 2 & 4: Smaller muscle groups groups of muscles</ul>

      <h2>Benefits and Reflections</h2>
      <p>
        Following a consistent routine of swimming and gym workouts has taught me a lot about discipline and self-motivation. Swimming once a week challenges my endurance and focus, while gym sessions strengthen my body and push me to improve every day. Over time, I have noticed better stamina, increased muscle strength, and a greater sense of personal achievement.

      <p>
        Beyond physical benefits, this routine also has a positive impact on my mental well-being. Organizing my workouts by muscle group makes training more effective and structured. Focusing on specific areas each day ensures that I am improving overall fitness without overworking myself. This approach has helped me stay consistent, set realistic goals, and enjoy the process of progressing gradually while staying committed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, sports are not just a hobby—they are a lifestyle. Swimming and gym workouts give me confidence, resilience, and a sense of balance in daily life. They remind me that progress takes time, dedication, and patience, and that the effort invested always pays off in the long run.

        <p>
          Engaging in regular physical activity, such as swimming and gym workouts, significantly reduces the risk of chronic diseases. The World Health Organization emphasizes that physical activity helps prevent and manage noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes, while also reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety

        <p>
          Regular participation in sports has been shown to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. A review published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that physical activity can reduce depression and anxiety symptoms, improve mood, and enhance cognitive function

          Routine physical activity plays a crucial role in both the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown that regular exercise is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality

        <h2>Sleep (Rest & Recovery)</h2>
        <p>Quality sleep has a powerful impact on how well your body recovers, especially when you train regularly. During deep sleep, your muscles repair microtears, and growth hormone is released, which supports recovery and strength gains. Researchers also emphasize that sleep is critical for cognitive function, memory consolidation, and emotional regulation. In my own routine, I have noticed that after a night when I sleep less than 7 hours, my lifts feel heavier, my focus in class is worse, and my mood tends to be more irritable.</p>
        <p>When I prioritize going to bed on time and ensuring a dark, quiet environment, I wake up more refreshed and energetic for both swimming and gym sessions. Consistent sleep also reduces my risk of illness and boosts my immune system, so I am less likely to miss training days. According to the CDC, getting enough sleep helps with metabolism, reduces stress, and supports heart health.For me, sleep is not just rest—it is an active part of my training strategy.</p>

        <h2>Stress (Mental Balance & Hormones)</h2>
        <p>Chronic stress is a silent adversary—it raises cortisol and can interfere with sleep, recovery, and motivation. Studies show that prolonged stress can impair the body’s use of nutrients, disrupt digestion, worsen mood, and weaken the immune system. I have experienced this personally: during exam weeks or when lots of work piles up, I tend to feel drained, skip workouts, or eat poorly because my mind is preoccupied.</p>
        <p>To counteract stress, I use simple techniques like short meditation breaks, breathing exercises, or walking outside. These help me reset mentally and reduce tension. Over time, managing stress has improved my consistency in workouts and daily life. From the research side, stress and diet are closely linked; stress can push people toward comfort foods, and poor diet worsens stress in a vicious cycle. For me, awareness of stress and taking small “mental breaks” has become as essential as warming up before the gym.</p>

        <h2>Healthy Food (Fuel & Performance)</h2>
        <p>Good nutrition is the foundation upon which everything else depends. Eating adequate protein supports muscle repair, while complex carbs, vegetables, and healthy fats give me sustained energy. Research shows that better diets are linked to improved mood and mental health, not just physical performance. When I am consistent with eating whole foods—lean meat, legumes, fruit, vegetables—I notice I recover faster and feel more alert during workouts and classes.</p>
